3) As a Help Desk Agent (John), review the ticket's properties, including:

- Priority
- Department
- SLA (Service Level Agreement)
- Assigned To
</p>
<br />
* Make sure John has access to the ticket that Karen "which is the end user" has created.

  <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
  
The protocols for how tickets are managed can differ depending on the work environment. There may be a quota for how many tickets need to be resolved within a certain time frame and certain tickets will have to be prioritized depending on the situation. I have built osTicket from scratch and was able to understand how tickets work in an IT position.
